    <h1>🌿 About Us — Nature Heals</h1>
    <p>At Nature Heals, we believe that healing is not found in pills or promises — it’s found in presence. It’s in the wind that touches your face, the trees that breathe with you, and the earth that has never stopped giving life.</p>

    <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
    <p>Nature does not rush, yet everything gets done. It doesn’t judge, yet it transforms everything it touches. We believe that by immersing ourselves in the energy of nature — through mindful walks, organic living, sustainable practices, natural remedies, and intentional stillness — we awaken our inner healing power.</p>

    <h3>What We Stand For</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>🌱 Healing Through Connection: Every leaf, every drop of water, every sunrise carries medicine for the soul.</li>
      <li>🌞 Holistic Living: We promote harmony between mind, body, and environment — because true wellness begins from within and extends outward.</li>
      <li>🌏 Sustainability and Love for the Earth: Healing ourselves means healing the planet. We support eco-friendly habits, reforestation, and respect for all living things.</li>
      <li>💫 Inner Awareness: Nature teaches silence, patience, and presence — the core ingredients of peace and emotional balance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Our Vision</h3>
    <p>To awaken a global movement of natural healers — ordinary people living extraordinary lives through the wisdom of the earth. We envision communities that live in gratitude, sustainability, and serenity, guided by the ancient truth that we are not separate from nature — we are nature.</p>

    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>To inspire, educate, and empower individuals to embrace nature-based healing through experiences, products, teachings, and mindful living. Whether through herbal wellness, eco-therapy, retreats, or simply learning to slow down and breathe, we exist to guide the world back to balance.</p>
